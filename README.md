#### 🔒 About My Work:

While I’m actively involved in Machine Learning, AI research, and innovative projects, you won’t find much of my work here on GitHub just yet. I prefer to keep my research private until it’s been **published** and **accepted** in respected journals or conferences. Once my work reaches that stage, I’ll share more of my projects and insights with the community. Stay tuned!

In the meantime, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dipali-pawar-2431b4192/) to stay updated or discuss potential collaborations!
